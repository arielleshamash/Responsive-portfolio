      <img src="assets/images/profilepic.png" class="auth-image" alt="Arielle">

      <p>Arielle was born on a sunny July morning in Tarzana, California.  She grew up with both parents, an older brother, and a few cats. BSing her way through high school, she incredibly got accepted to college. After starting at the University of Oregon, she studied environmental science and attained a Bachelor of Science degree with a minor in Judaic Studies.</p>

      <p>From there, she decided the best course of action was to start bartending under the presumption that it would help her pay for grad school.  Unforturnately, 5 years later, she is still bartending and has lost all hope of going back to school to pursue a masters degree in environmental science. </p>

      <p>In a desperate attempt to escape the customer service industry, she signed up for a coding bootcamp with the hopes it will lead to a career that doesn't involve having to smile and say thank you to everyone even when they are rude. Her ultimate goal is to be able to go and sit at a bar or restaurant with her laptop and it still be considered "working".</p>
